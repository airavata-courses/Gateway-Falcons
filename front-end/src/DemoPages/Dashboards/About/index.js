                                                        <p>
                                                            Thank you for visiting Schwenck.Live! April 15th 2019 began my 5,800-mile bicycle journey from New York City to Alaska to collect and analyze data from 25 variables for research. This decision, however, did not come out of thin air.
                                                                </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            When the doctors told me that I have a problematic heart condition and suggested I limit my exercise, I naturally asked, "why?" I have excelled at football, rugby, and skiing my entire life and have never once had an issue. Being that this condition is relatively uncommon for highly active individuals, I am considered an outlier. With the lack of available research to draw conclusions from, they advised I take the safe route.
                                                                </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            This did not resonate well with me at all. If a lack of research is going to hold me back from doing what I love, then I am determined to find an answer myself by conducting research that will help advance the scientific and medical communities. When debating ideas for an experiment, I thought back to my parentsâ€¦
                                                                </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            My father was 25 when he decided to set out for California on his bicycle - more than 3,700 miles - starting New Jersey. Over the course of 67 days, he endured the rain, heat, and wind with nothing but a tent, sleeping bag, and change of clothes. Upon his return, he was hungry for more. He and my mother - an equally avid cyclist - decided to push the limit and ride to Alaska. Despite the progress they made, their trip to the Last Frontier was put on hold once they realized I was on the way sooner than they were planning. Finishing their trip is the answer to my research.

                                                                I do not simply wish to raise money for others' research, I want to be on the front lines spearheading the investigation myself, finding solutions and figuring out ways to intertwine "big data" and Statistics with other seemingly disparate fields such as Neuroscience, Cardiology, and Physiology.

                                                        At the end of the day, the goal for any research experiment is to answer the questions we all have about the world around us.</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        For me personally, I am most curious about how the well-being of our health is impacted by various external stress factors,
                                                        some of which we can control and others we cannot, as tested through a multitude of environments.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        I have set up a routine that will allow me to standardize my health measurements as best I can using as little time as possible. There will be times when the circumstances warrant a missed read or a data integrity issue, but my hope is that in the long run, I will have an adequate dataset to work with. When considering which factors to analyze, I wanted to assess sleep, hydration, and diet (as these are directly controllable) in addition those beyond my control such as weather and elevation. These all serve to gain clarity and insight for understanding how the response variables -- riding and cardiac performance -- change through time under various environments.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        There are trade-offs to every experimental design type. For this particular experiment, as it is a pilot study, the most obvious is the "n of 1" issue. By standardizing as much as I can, I hope to allow for future replication to obtain a more representative sample of individuals who also fit the same criteria. I am always open to discussing new ideas or improvements; if you would like to considering partnering or collaborating, feel free to email me at schwenck.live@gmail.com.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Admittedly, my passion lies in the field of Statistics, not necessarily the medical or physiological fields, but I see these communities as golden opportunities to implement the latest statistical methodologies to innovate to make a positive impact. I plan to leverage what I learn during my graduate studies in the field of Statistics to improve an individual's overall health using AI and 'big data' to suggest alternative solutions to medicine.
